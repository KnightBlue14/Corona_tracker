# Corona_tracker
A personal project I put together at the start of the pandemic back in 2020. Can be considered defunct, now that the pandemic is over, and the figures are not being tracked anymore.

Running the application downloads the official UK stats from the government website, then uses them to produce a series of graphs for various statistics (number of cases over time, number of deaths over time, etc.). The methods used for tracking also changed a few times as they were being updated, so the results from here do not necessarily represent reality.
